            <h1>Gay people shouldn't be banned from donating blood</h1>
            <p>Right now, any man who had sex with another man is banned from donating blood. Most LGBTQ organizations view these policies as based on homophobia rather than legitimate medical reasons.</p>

                    with men (MSM) in the Philippines cannot donate blood</a>.
                    Even in other countries such as the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/02/826096978/fda-loosens-restrictions-on-gay-blood-donors-amid-urgent-need-caused-by-coronavi">United States of America</a>,

                <p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blood-donation-shortage-us-2021/">During the CoVid pandemic, a blood shortage in the US happened which forced hospitals to postpone some surgeries</a>. Yet this wasn't uncommon - blood shortages
                    have happened many times in the past. When vast amounts of people are unable to donate blood, even if they wanted to help, they cannot do so - and this is currently the case with gay men. However, it is important to remember that this ban does not exist for no reason.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Arguments supporting the ban</h2>
            <p class="subtitle">And why they aren't right</p>
            
            <div class="arguments">
                <div class="argument">
                    <h3>The safety of the blood supply is more important than the feelings of gay men.</h3>
                    <p>While true, blood is almost always tested for diseases including HIV. A polyamorous male with multiple partners is at higher risk for HIV than a monogamous couple yet the former is able to donate. Bans should be based on risk behavior and not on gender identity.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="argument">
                    <h3>We should focus on getting blood from those who are eligible.</h3>
                    <p>It would still remove a whole lot of good blood from people who want to donate. A gay man with O negative blood (the so-called "universal donor") is unable to donate his blood simply because he's gay.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="argument">
                    <h3>Tests are not perfect and thus blanket bans may be necessary to ensure safety.</h3>
                    <p>While it’s true that no HIV test is perfect, a blanket ban based on gender identity rather than risk behaviour is discriminatory. Men who had multiple female sex partners can donate blood but are not discriminated against yet are still at elevated risks than similar demographics.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

        <section class="section-4">
            <h2 class="section-title">How do I support this advocacy?</h2>
            
            <div class="action">
                <h3>Support a ban based on risk behaviour rather than a blanket one based on gender identity.</h3>
                <p>A blanket ban discriminates against any person in the group who practices safe sexual practices. A man who does not use condoms and has multiple female sex partners is not safer than a gay man in a monogamous relationship because of his sexual orientation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="action">
                <h3>Support increased and better testing of blood.</h3>
                <p>Better testing is one of the reasons the ban has been shortened in many countries. Better testing means that we are now able to screen out blood samples faster and cheaper while ensuring the safety of the blood supply from sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
